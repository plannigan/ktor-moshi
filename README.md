# Ktor-Moshi

[Ktor][ktor] is a framework for building asynchronous servers and clients in connected systems. Ktor allows the
application to decide how data should be serialized/deserialized when sent over the network.

Ktor-Moshi allows an application to use [Moshi][moshi] when dealing with JSON content.

## Usage

### Server

When implementing a server, the [ContentNegotiation][content_negotiation] feature will convert the content. Bellow is
an example of installing Moshi for content negotiation:

```kotlin
install(ContentNegotiation) {
  moshi {
    // Configure the Moshi.Builder here.
    add(Date::class.java, Rfc3339DateJsonAdapter())
  }
}
```

A [Moshi.Builder][moshi_builder] is available inside the `moshi` block if it needs to be customized. In this example,
Moshi's pre-build [RFC-3339 Date adapter][date_adapter] is added.

Alternatively, if the application already has a `Moshi` instance, it can be provided instead of creating a new one.

```kotlin
install(ContentNegotiation) {
  moshi(myExistingMoshiInstance)
}
```

Refer to the [ContentNegotiation][content_negotiation] documentation for information on how to send and receive
formatted data.

### Client

When implementing a client, the [Json feature][json_feature] will convert the content. Bellow is
an example of installing Moshi for serializing JSON content:

```kotlin
val client = HttpClient(HttpClientEngine) {
    install(JsonFeature) {
        serializer = MoshiSerializer {
          add(Rfc3339DateJsonAdapter())
        }
    }
}
```

A [Moshi.Builder][moshi_builder] is available inside the `MoshiSerializer` block if it needs to be customized. In this
example, Moshi's pre-build [RFC-3339 Date adapter][date_adapter] is added.

Alternatively, if the application already has a `Moshi` instance, it can be provided instead of creating a new one.

```kotlin
val client = HttpClient(HttpClientEngine) {
    install(JsonFeature) {
        serializer = MoshiSerializer(myExistingMoshiInstance)
    }
}
```

Refer to the [Client][client_calls] documentation for information on how to send and receive formatted data.

## Download

Each component (server & client) are published as independent packages.

Add a gradle dependency to your project:

* Server:

```groovy
implementation 'com.hypercubetools:ktor-moshi-server:LATEST_VERSION'
```

* Client:

```groovy
implementation 'com.hypercubetools:ktor-moshi-client:LATEST_VERSION'
```
